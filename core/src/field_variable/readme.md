A field variable is a spatially discretized function that is defined on the computational domain. For that the basis functions are used and also mesh information is needed. Therefore field variables are templated by a BasisOnMesh class. 
A field variable has a string name and can have multiple components which are identified by the name. There exists methods to get and set all values of a field variable associated to an element at once. This should be used because it is faster than accessing single values.
At the basis of a field variable is a PETSc Vec object that stores all values contiguously in memory. It can be accessed for reading and writing by the values() method. The memory layout is such that all component values of a single dof are together in memory. This is cache efficient and enables vectorization. It is opposite to the default OpenCMISS storage order.
