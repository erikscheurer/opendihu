This directory contains some general management classes and needs some tidying up later. The DihuContext class stores the global manager objects for meshes and solvers and contains a representation of the python config. The class name "DihuContext" needs to be revised. The computation class is quite useless and needs to be removed. The other headers should maybe be moved somewhere else.
