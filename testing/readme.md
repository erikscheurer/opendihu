This directory contains all testing functionality. The `src` subdirectory contains source files where the tests are implemented using the gtest API. All tests are automatically run after each compilation, therefore the testcases should be small and fast to not waste compile time. After compilation an executable `run_tests` is created in one of the build folders `build_debug` or `build_release`(depending on the build type). You can run the tests manually by executing that binary. A subset of tests can be selected with a command line argument as follows:
`./run_tetsts --gtest_filter=<example name, wildcards (*) are possible>`
