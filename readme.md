Opendihu is a software framework that solves static and dynamic multi-physics problems, spatially discretized in 1D, 2D and 3D by the finite element method.
The core design goals are usability, performance and extensibility. It is developed at [SGS](https://www.ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de/abteilungen/sgs/index.html?__locale=en) and [IANS](https://www.ians.uni-stuttgart.de/institute/) at [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/index.html).

Documentation including [installation instructions](https://opendihu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html) can be found at [opendihu.readthedocs.io](https://opendihu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
