# Overview
The working title of this software framework is "opendihu" - from the project name "Digital Human". It serves as a code base to solve static and dynamic problems, where the Finite Element Method is used for spatial discretization. Due to its modular nature it is supposed to be adaptible for future problems.

# Relationship to OpenCMISS
* Probably `*.ex` files will be supported for the beginning to be able to use cmgui. (Currently a reader/writer for exelem/exnode files for unstructured meshes is implemented.)

# Possible items for the feature list
* T. Heidlauf multi-scale electro-chemo-mechanical model of skeletal muscle
* Addition of Bidomain EMG model of Milena 
* Multi-compartment model by Thomas
* Addition of neural feedback model
* Dynamic mechanical formulation

# Roadmap
* continuum mechanics model
* multi-compartment model
* Heidlauf model (wtihout EMG)
* shared memory parallelisation
* distributed memory parallelisation
* integration of VIS file format
