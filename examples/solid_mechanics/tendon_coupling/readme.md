# Coupling two tendons


## About the single tendon case

We can choose a small force, eg force = 100 but then we dont see any movement.
For forces > 1000 we get messages for negatative det J, but the tendon still does not move.

If we have an increasing force until t = 0.5, then we can manage final forces until 4e3.

For comparison purposes we have chosen force = 1e5 increasing until 20.0.
