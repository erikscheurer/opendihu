This directory contains a lot of input files that are used by the `electrophysiology` examples.
Because some of them are large, this directory is not part of the github repository.

It is available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ssGRgDz1uQcsoWeuE6ldUAn7-SW1YkH/view?usp=sharing
(or on the IPVS nextcloud, currently not working: https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/cloud/s/LGdatFXDnc2yJKb)

```
cd $OPENDIHU_HOME/electrophysiology/input
# download file to this directory
tar xf input.tgz
```
